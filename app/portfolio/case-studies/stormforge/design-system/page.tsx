            When I first started with StormForge, the UI was nearly non-existent. It was clear we needed to scrap the
            existing front-end, and replace it with a solid design system, and scaleable component library.

          <p className="text-base mb-6">
            I served as the lead designer, and design manager. My role was to work with the multiple stakeholders within
            the company to not only redesign the product and create the visual language, but also make what was being
            designed in Figma translated to a React component library.

            <li>Determine visual language.</li>
            <li>Prototype out ideas.</li>
            <li>Gather feedback from internal stakeholders.</li>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Determine visual language with feedback internally</h4>
            <p className="text-base mb-4">
              The first step was to capture the soul of the product visually. I did so by creating a number of visual
              explorations to try and gauge the feedback of what is most favorable. Since I had a good idea that we were
              going to go down the Material UI route, I used Material Design as a visual framework. Also, since we did
              not have current customers, I kept the feedback internally.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base mb-4">
              The company had existing brand guidelines determined by marketing. This was actually a problem because the
              brand guidelines didn't translate as well to the product UI. The colors were muted, and non-complementary.
              It had a mix of sea foam green and pink, which created accessibility problems with contrast, and well, was
              sort of ugly.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base mb-4">
              I grabbed aspects of the color palette, and created a few explorations. I sent this out to the company
              attached with a poll to gather feedback on what people were feeling. Dark mode, neutral, overwhelming was
              preferred. Below are examples that I put together.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Implementation</h3>
          <p className="text-base mb-6">
            Working with engineering, we landed on MUI (Material UI). This decision was mostly decided on based on
            velocity and flexibility. We didn't want another UI that looks like gmail. We wanted the flexibility of the
            theming system of MUI, and enjoyed an existing set of React components as to not reinvent the wheel. The
            name of the game here was velocity. We knew we needed to get a ton of UI out the door quickly, but we didn't
            want to rack up lots of tech debt because of this velocity.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Result</h3>
          <p className="text-base mb-6">
            We were very happy with the results. In about a month, we had redesigned the UI, and had a design system
            that was a 1:1 match Figma to React components.
